	abstract = {A speciﬁc model for drug absorption is necessarily assumed in pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses following extravascular dosing. Unfortunately, an inappropriate absorption model may force other model parameters to be poorly estimated. An added complexity arises in population PK analyses when different individuals appear to have different absorption patterns. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that a deep neural network (DNN) can be used to prescreen data and assign an individualized absorption model consistent with either a ﬁrst-order, Erlang, or split-peak process. Ten thousand proﬁles were simulated for each of the three aforementioned shapes and used for training the DNN algorithm with a 30\% hold-out validation set. During the training phase, a 99.7\% accuracy was attained, with 99.4\% accuracy during in the validation process. In testing the algorithm classiﬁcation performance with external patient data, a 93.7\% accuracy was reached. This algorithm was developed to prescreen individual data and assign a particular absorption model prior to a population PK analysis. We envision it being used as an efﬁcient prescreening tool in other situations that involve a model component that appears to be variable across subjects. It has the potential to reduce the time needed to perform a manual visual assignment and eliminate inter-assessor variability and bias in assigning a sub-model.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The current study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, level of knowledge and attitudes to seasonal influenza vaccination among older adults in Jordan.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in which a close-ended questionnaire was administered to older adults (65 years or older) in two major cities in Jordan between May 2018 and July 2018. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered the cutoff level for statistical significance.
Results: Among 500 participants, only 1.2\% (n = 6) received a seasonal influenza vaccine during the previous year. In assessing influenza disease and influenza vaccine knowledge, 47.8\% had good knowledge. Around 61\% of older adults reported influenza vaccine is effective against preventing influenza however, 49.8\% reported that influenza could be treated with the influenza vaccine. Moreover, 27\% thought the influenza vaccine is important for older adults. In terms of attitudes toward the vaccine, 24.6\% had positive attitudes and 40.6\% strongly agreed/agreed that influenza is a serious disease in older adults and they should take the influenza vaccine to prevent influenza.
Conclusion: The results of this study showed an extremely poor influenza vaccination rate among older adults and a low level of influenza vaccination knowledge and attitudes.},

Method: Antimicrobial use was obtained using a pre-designed data collection form in this point prevalence study. Setting: The study was conducted in a tertiary academic hospital in the North of Jordan on 13 August 2018. Main outcome measures: antimicrobial use was determined using two methods: defined daily use (DDD) and days of therapy (DOT).
Results: This study identified antimicrobial use in 144 patients. Carbapenems, glycopeptides, and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most utilized antimicrobials in the inpatients’ setting in both measures DDD and DOT. The highest prescription rate of antibiotics was in the internal medicine wards (49.8 DDD/100 admissions), followed by surgery wards (33.2 DDD/100 admissions) and intensive care unit (20.6 DDD/100 admissions).
Conclusion: This surveillance study addressed patterns of antimicrobial usage in inpatients settings in a tertiary care hospital in Jordan. This practice is feasible and could be adopted routinely by anti­ microbial stewardship programs.},

	abstract = {Methods: A nonlinear mixed-effect modelling approach was used to analyse cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione concentrations obtained over 6 hours from children with CAH (n = 50). A circadian rhythm was evident and the model leveraged literature information on circadian rhythm in untreated children with CAH. Indirect response models were applied in which cortisol inhibited the production rate of all three compounds using an Imax model.
Results: Cortisol was characterized by a one-compartment model with apparent clearance and volume of distribution estimated at 22.9 L/h/70 kg and 41.1 L/70 kg, respectively. The IC50 values of cortisol concentrations for cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione were estimated to be 1.36, 0.45 and 0.75 μg/dL, respectively. The inhibitory effect was found to be more potent on 17OHP than D4A, and the IC50 values were higher in salt-wasting subjects than simple virilizers. Production rates of cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione were higher in simple-virilizer subjects. Half-lives of cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione were 60, 47 and 77 minutes, respectively.
Conclusion: Rapidly changing biomarker responses to cortisol concentrations highlight that single measurements provide volatile information about a child's disease control. Our model closely captured observed cortisol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androstenedione concentrations. It can be used to predict concentrations over 24 hours and allows many novel exposure metrics to be calculated, e.g., AUC, AUCabove-threshold, time-within-range, etc. Our long-range goal is to uncover dose–},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Currently there are no commercially available hydrocortisone formulations for the treatment of children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) that allow for smaller doses (0.1-1.25 mg) and incremental adjustments needed to control excess androgen production and avoid the negative effects of overtreatment. This lack of availability has led physicians to recommend dividing hydrocortisone 5-mg tablets into 4 to 6 pieces, compounding capsules or hydrocortisone suspension, or crushing 5- or 10-mg tablets in 5 or 10 mL of water. We report a case of iatrogenic Cushing syndrome in a 6-year 11-month-old girl with salt-wasting CAH treated with hydrocortisone tablets that were administered after crushing and dispersing into water to obtain the prescribed dose. She presented with poor growth, increasing body mass index (BMI), excess downy hair, round facies, and gastric ulcers. Her hydrocortisone dose was 8.1 mg/m2/day. Results for all adrenal steroid concentrations were undetectable at 8 am, 12 hours after her last dose. The year prior to presentation her parents began dissolving 10 mg of hydrocortisone in 10 mL of water and using this preparation over the course of 24 hours, which coincided with rapid increase of BMI. We switched her to a pharmacy-compounded alcohol-free hydrocortisone suspension with total daily doses ranging from 6.5 to 8.2 mg/m2/day, which resulted in resolution of her cushingoid features, a decrease in BMI, and catch-up growth. Our case highlights that manipulation of hydrocortisone tablets by parents can result in great variability in dosing and the need for commercially available pediatric formulations allowing for smaller dosing required in young children.},

	abstract = {Prophylactic voriconazole use is recommended for children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Dosing considerations are essential, due to the narrow therapeutic window of voriconazole. Known covariates do not sufﬁciently explain the large interindividual pharmacokinetic (PK) variability of voriconazole. Moreover, knowledge of voriconazole PK for age ,2 years is limited. We investigated genetic and clinical covariate associations with voriconazole interindividual PK variability and subsequently simulated dosing regimens in children. This study was conducted as part of a single-institution, phase I study of intravenous voriconazole therapy for children undergoing HCT. We conducted a population PK analysis and tested covariate effects on voriconazole PK, including 67 genetic variants and clinical variables. We analyzed plasma voriconazole and N-oxide metabolite concentrations from 58 children ,21 years of age (including 12 children ,2 years of age). A two-compartment parent mixed linear/nonlinear model best described our data. The CYP2C19 phenotype and body weight were signiﬁcant covariates (P , 0.05 for both). Our model performance for age ,2 years was comparable to that for other age groups. Simulation of the ﬁnal model suggested the following doses to attain target steady-state trough concentrations of 1.5 to 5.0 mg/liter for the CYP2C19 normal phenotype: 16 mg/kg (weight of ,15 kg), 12 mg/kg (weight of 15 to 30 kg), or 10 mg/kg (weight of .30 kg); doses were 33 to 50\% lower for CYP2C19 poor/intermediate phenotypes and 25 to 50\% higher for CYP2C19 rapid/ultrarapid phenotypes. We propose a new starting-dose regimen, combined with therapeutic drug monitoring, for intravenous voriconazole therapy in children of all ages. Future studies should validate this dosing regimen.},
